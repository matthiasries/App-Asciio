remove single wirl arrow object
	=> a connection error occures when using a multiple wirl object with a single wirl
		write a test where two boxes are connected with one type of arrow
		and two other boxes with the other type of arrow, move the boxes around and 
		compare the display

*** unhandled exception in callback:
***   Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript -1 at lib/gpad_undo.pm line 115.
***  ignoring at ./gpad.pl line 95.

add easy way, through a shortcut,  to:
	change arrow type
		dots, equal, star, ...
	make an arrow a muti wirl arow
		=> use only multi wirl arrow
	#box a text
	#change box type

Selection rectangle that just takes boxes

move action constants to module

connections connected to a start and an end connector are displayed with warning color
	move to display plugins

multi wirl extension as if we were drawing the arrow
	when the mouse takes a turn, a wirl point is added
	
optimize do_stack serialization
	# use bzip2
	=> diff + compress
		# tests done
		must have a reverse diff that can patch both ways or it's not worth it
		
now arrow can match inside a box, moving an arrow around has become more tricky
	=> do not connect if both ends are unconnected and arrow is being moved
	
dialogs
	button missing icons
	assign ctl + enter as OK in edit boxes
		=> alt + C

#flip start and end of arrows

#action can register themselves so they can add entries in context menues

#CREATE_BACKUP is saved and restored with the files!

#arrow pointing in both direction
	#wirl
	#multi wirl

	#quick insert short cut for both

#do pod saving and loading without external commands and files

#remove the cp command call and other backticks

#connected box.pl with 3 boxes doesn't canonize the links properly
	note that we are giving a missleading hint to start with
	=> connections are right
	
!record gpad with do_stack and add a play_gpad script
	=> better to save screenshots that are taken when using a keyboard shortcut
	=> we can also record snippets, by recording at each create_undo_snapshot

	=> use screencast
	
#exporting an imported pod generates a slightly different base64
	check a gpade dump
	=> Dumper had different order
	
#error when copying element that has connections
	appeared after quick link implementation
	connection seems to be wrong as it moves with the copied element but is not connected
	difficult to reproduce
	
#shortcut to change the direction of an arrow instead for using wirl

!auto connect with quick link uses the closest to the pointer
	give hint to wirl creation
	=> better to be consistent. preference can be given in actions/mouse.pl
	
#action shortcut should not be gtk dependent

# remove redo_stack_maximum_size

#action should register a name we can call them with  instead for calling them by keyboard mapping

#move %loaded_types in gpad_io to object

#save file sets title, or not
	
#gpad format is unreadable anyway, compress

#gpade import/export
	remove gpade from gpad

# importer can set the title

#open save POD

#use work directory

#remove all unecessary use from the action files

#open save export as plugins

#saving as xx.txt will not save anything in gpad anymore

! add --setup to locate the setup directory

	#=> wait till tab to space is defined
	
#command to generate a stencil ready definition from the current state of an object
	=> load multiple stencils and keep the filesystem structure in the popup menues
	=> allow shortcut to be associated with the stencil elements (by name and in setup files)

#drawing arrow into box connects the arrow

#transfor tabs to space

#only allow start-end connectors to link for multiwirl
	but allow moving of the intermediate connectors

#shortcut that adds elements but opens the edit dialog directly before inserting the object
	should this be the default for object creation from stencils?
		=> shall we add a EDIT_ON_CREATE fields=

#ctl + shift + arrows => connect arrows as connect boxes does

#color groups when using solid background
	=> through a get_element_background_color

#error shift plus select area doesn't work

#do notshow resize rectangle if attribut is not set

#error after aligning box centers, the connectors are real weird in if_elsif.gpad

#verify all the '* $character_' and '\ $character_'

#editing box breaks the connections

#?use DTD::GTK for dumps

#quick insert for text (same as quick insert for boxes)

#save element's X Y in character sizes

#access stencil elements by name

!add module with shared constants (ie setup)
	=> later
	
#update_diagram should be configurable
	make a module so we can optimize a connection at the time
		canonize uses $self for character size only
	? ask for the optimal connection before creating it

#subs to connect specific connectors wherever the elements are and they are sized

#script using cononize_connection doesn't work, path was changed

#make a script library

!update_diagram should be called when running in script mode
	let the script writer decide if they want "optimized" connections or not

# proper setup structure

#editable arrow has connections!! use resize/info/highlight points instead

# export ASCII to clipboard

#quick connect
	if selected elements
		connect element under to selected elements
		deselect all
	else
		select element
		
#forward mouse to ACTIONS

#$dragging moved to class
	setting it should be possible through an API

#auto connect that moves an arrow start should update the end connector

#alignment tool

#single group element copied still thinks it part of a group

#changing text in if reconnect wrong

#set/get_text

	show connectors connections
	
#resize connectee doesn't move the connector

#move  group looses connections

#resizing downright arrow flips it to rightdown

handle multiple character start and end in angled arrow
handle \t in text

#after changing line glyphs, it becomes right down from right up !!

#ungrouping moves object up
selecting a single group element, through selection rectangle, selects the whole group
	right?

#saving named objects uses the objects contents for the next copy

#save doesn't save grouping !!
	save elements without NAME to avoid overriding object at load time

?? seems that selection rectangle sometimes doesn't work

#selection is done botom  up instead for the opposite!
#when bg selection is on, can't select fg

selecting an element that is between two grouped elements is not possible

!selection cycles through objects when clicking + tab

#BOX2 with title and text only displays wrong size

#box and arrow streching are not ont the same
	box doesn't accept row 0

#can't loade face file

#edit text to empty string

#if only one element is editable in a group, edit it
	present selection box if multiple editable objects

#handle \ in text for pango

#_ is removed from name in menues

spell cheker

#grouping

Window size in character multiples
Drag drop objects from views or other aflow instance
Select font
Colored font
Background color
#Stencils are normal files
#Grouping, alignment, send back/front
#Grid display
#Horizontal and vertical alignement lines
!Objects are hilighted when overed (incuding groups)
#Select and move object with a single click
#Multiple object selection
Save in multiple format, try to keep extra attributes like color
        text, raw text, html

!Object is an instance of a class
        node can change class (eg from square to round)
        class can be modified (eg color change for all nodes)

Node class defines the node's apparence, class is a script

User defined key mapping, mouse mapping and menu mapping
#Static object mode
        select object(s) and click to insert it without drag drop

Layers?
        each layer has its tab and one can see through tabs
        how does this play with split window

Scripts can add their mappings

Scripts can generate new graphs
Re-order script so objects without link are aligned under each other
Routing and reordering script
Script can be save in stencil
Drag drop script object executes it
